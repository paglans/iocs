# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
MODULES = /opt/epics/synApps-R6-3-2a/support
AREADETECTOR = $(MODULES)/areaDetector
#MYMODULE = $(MODULES)/my-module
ASYN = $(MODULES)/asyn-R4-45
AUTOSAVE = $(MODULES)/autosave-R5-11
BUSY = $(MODULES)/busy-R1-7-4
CALC = $(MODULES)/calc-R3-7-5
DEVIOSTATS = $(MODULES)/iocStats-3-1-16
SSCAN = $(MODULES)/sscan-R2-11-6
ADCORE = $(AREADETECTOR)/ADCore
ADANDOR = $(AREADETECTOR)/ADAndor
ADSUPPORT = $(AREADETECTOR)/ADSupport
ALIVE = $(MODULES)/alive-R1-4-1

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/sequencer-mirror-R2-2-9

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE = /opt/epics/epics-base-7.0.9

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
